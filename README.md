<h1 align="center" style="color: red">Plugin is no longer active / maintained</h1>
<h4>This project was a great excuse to learn new things, but this awesome part of my life needs to be closed.</h4>
I am no longer an active developer of PLM solutions, and I do not have any use of this plugin. What is more important
this project did not gain any major interest from PLM community. That's why I think there is no point in further
investment of time here, maybe there will be something better/new which will be interesting to me.

<h4 align="center">Thank you</h4>
